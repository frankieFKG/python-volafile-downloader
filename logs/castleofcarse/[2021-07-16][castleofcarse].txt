[2021-07-16--17:45:17][+][Zorkprime][what I miss?]
[2021-07-16--20:03:33][][Tisiphone][Daphine, thanks for FASERIP!]
[2021-07-16--20:37:42][~+][Daphine][Hi hi Haukea :)]
[2021-07-16--20:38:07][~+][Daphine][No problem Tisiphone.  Hit up https://classicmarvelforever.com/cms/ for the rest of it that I don't have the badwidth to upload LOL]
[2021-07-16--20:43:09][+][Haukea][Daphine - How fares?]
[2021-07-16--20:54:23][~+][Daphine][meh +/- at the same time.  How about you?]
[2021-07-16--20:56:13][+][Haukea][Meh to Meh -. Got another random, nonsensical, rather dusturbing email from a brother. Going to see if the police think I have enough to get a court-issued no-contact-order.]
[2021-07-16--20:58:21][~+][Daphine][Ouch... good luck with that :/]
[2021-07-16--21:02:38][+][Haukea][Will see what happens. Him living in a rural area (not the city where I live), and being under the jurisdiction of the RCMP makes thing...interesting.]
[2021-07-16--21:04:02][~+][Daphine][RCMP?]
[2021-07-16--21:04:22][][Mneme][Royal Canadian Mounted Police.]
[2021-07-16--21:04:32][+][Haukea][Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Sort of a Provincial slash Federal Police force.]
[2021-07-16--21:04:55][+][Haukea][Adds to the bureaucracy of things basically.]
[2021-07-16--21:06:22][~+][Daphine][Ah.  Bureaucracy sucks.]
[2021-07-16--21:07:19][+][Haukea][My understanding is it's less work for the RCMP to ask the City Police for help, but it's exponentially & inversely proportionate for the City to get the RCMP involved.]
